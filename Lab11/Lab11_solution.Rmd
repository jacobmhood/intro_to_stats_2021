## Part 1 Panel Data Structure 

```{r, echo=F}

# load data into the environment
data(Wages, package = "plm")

Wages_clean <- Wages %>%
        # Add person ID: genearte a number sequence from 1 to 595, 
        # each number repeats for numbers of observation in the panel 
  mutate(pid = rep(1:595, each = nrow(Wages)/595),
        # Add year: generate a number sequence from 1976 to 1982, 
        # and repeat this sequence for 595 times
         year = rep(1976:1982, times = 595))

```

### Part 1 Exercise 

  Before estimating models, let's create some descriptive plots for exploratory purposes. Suppose we are interested in the relationship between **years of full-time work experience** and **wage**. Replicate the the plot below following the listed steps. This plot contains two panels, with one illustrating the aggregate relationship and the other the individual-level trajectories.
  
![](graph/exercise1.png){width=60%}  

  1. Sample ten persons from the dataset;
  2. Create an "aggregate trend" scatter plot of these individuals across all observation years with an OLS regression line for the variable `exp` and `lwage` (the upper panel);
  3. Similarly, create an "individual trend" scatter plot (the lower panel);
  4. Arrange the two plots using `grid.arrange()`, post your plot to Slack;
  5. How does the relationship between `exp` and `lwage` differ in these two plots? What would be the possible reasons for the difference?  
  
  Note: Due to sample randomness, it is okay if your plots look different from the example. It is also fine if your plot has legends. 

```{r , message=F}

# sample pid
set.seed(930412)
pid_sample <- sample(1:595, 10, replace = FALSE)

# Look at aggregate trend
fig1 <- Wages_clean %>%
  filter(pid %in% pid_sample) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = exp, y = lwage)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)

# Look at individual trend
fig2 <- Wages_clean %>%
  filter(pid %in% pid_sample) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = exp, y = lwage, color = as.factor(pid), group = as.factor(pid))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

grid.arrange(fig1, fig2)

```
  
```{r , message=F, echo=F }  

# Sample pid by gender
set.seed(930412)
pid_bysex <- Wages_clean %>%
  distinct(pid, .keep_all = T) %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  sample_n(10) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  pull(pid)

```

## Part 2 Fixed Effects and Random Effects Models

```{r , echo = F}

# Simple OLS model (for purpose of comparison)
m_ols <- lm(lwage ~ exp + sex, data = Wages_clean)

# Fixed effects model -using person dummies
m_fe_dummy <- lm(lwage ~ exp + as.factor(pid) , data = Wages_clean)

# Fixed effects model -using plm package
# model = "within" indicates fixed effects model
# index = c("pid") is the grouping variable in your fixed effects model
m_fe <- plm(lwage ~ exp, data = Wages_clean, model = "within", index = c("pid"))

# Random effects model -using plm package
m_re <- plm(lwage ~ exp + sex, data = Wages_clean, model = "random", index = c("pid"))

# Save a subsample of the gender-balanced 20 individuals sampled earlier 
Wages_sample <- Wages_clean %>%
  filter(pid %in% pid_bysex) %>%
  dplyr::select(pid, lwage, sex, exp)
# A df that match pid with gender
sample_gender_key <- Wages_sample %>%
  dplyr::select(pid, sex) %>%
  distinct(pid, .keep_all = T)

# Create a number sequence for years of experience
exp_seq = seq(1, 46, 1)

# --------- predicted effect of the fixed effects model -----------

# Create a IV df with pid and years of experience based on the subsample
IV_fe <- tibble(
  pid = rep(pid_bysex, each = length(exp_seq)),
  exp = rep(exp_seq, times = 20)
  )

# Get predicted Y using the OLS dummy model
yhat_fe <- predict(m_fe_dummy, newdata = IV_fe, interval = "confidence")

# Combine results
predict_fe <- cbind(IV_fe, yhat_fe) %>%
  left_join(sample_gender_key, by = "pid")

# --------- predicted effect of the random effects model -----------

# dataset to make predictions
IV_re <-  tibble(
    pid = rep(pid_bysex, each = length(exp_seq)),
    exp = rep(exp_seq, times = 20)
) %>%
  left_join(sample_gender_key, by = "pid")

# here predictions are based on alpha + X_{it}\beta
yhat_temp_re <-  predict(m_re, newdata = IV_re)
    
# predict eta using `ranef` function
eta_re <- ranef(m_re) %>%
  cbind(pid = as.numeric(names(.)), 
        eta = .) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  filter(pid %in% Wages_sample$pid)

# merge predicted eta_i to tmp_rand
predict_re <- cbind(IV_re, yhat_temp_re) %>%
  left_join(eta_re, by = "pid") %>%
  # add eta_i to alpha + X_{it}\beta
  mutate(yhat_re = yhat_temp_re + eta)

# --------- predicted effect of the OLS model -----------
predict_ols <- Effect(
  # Key IVs for which you examine the predicted effects
  c("sex", "exp"),   
  m_ols,
  # Values of IVs
  xlevels = list(
    sex = c(replicate("female", n = length(exp_seq)), 
            replicate("male", n = length(exp_seq))),
    exp = rep(exp_seq)
    ),
  # Set confidence intervals
  confidence.level = .95) %>%
  # Convert to dataframe
  as.data.frame()

```

### Part 2 Exercise

Try to recreate the figure below that demonstrates the three different model curves by each individual's pid. Make sure that you run all the code chunks before this question to ensure you have necessary objects in your R environment. Then, to simplify the steps, you can create a dataframe that is ready for plotting using the code provided in the following code chunk.  

![](graph/exercise2.png){width=70%}

```{r }

# Prepare df for combine
predict_fe_temp <- predict_fe %>% 
  dplyr::select(pid, exp, sex, fit) %>%
  rename(yhat_fe = fit)

predict_re_temp <- predict_re %>% 
  dplyr::select(pid, exp, sex, yhat_re)

predict_ols_temp <- predict_ols %>% 
  dplyr::select(exp, sex, fit) %>%
  rename(yhat_ols = fit)

# Combine yhat of three models
predict_combine <- predict_fe_temp %>%
  full_join(predict_re_temp, by = c("pid", "exp", "sex")) %>%
  left_join(predict_ols_temp, by = c("exp", "sex")) %>%
  left_join(Wages_sample, by = c("pid", "exp", "sex"))

```

Your code for plotting below:

```{r }

# Plot
predict_combine %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = exp, y = yhat_ols, color = "OLS")) +
  geom_line(aes(x = exp, y = yhat_fe, color = "Fixed Effects")) +
  geom_line(aes(x = exp, y = yhat_re, color = "Random Effects")) +
  geom_point(aes(x = exp, y = lwage), shape = 1, alpha = 0.6) +
  facet_wrap(.~pid) + 
  scale_colour_manual(name = "", values = c("black", "darkmagenta", "darkcyan")) +
  labs(x = "years of experience", y = "log wage")


```
