## Setting up environment 
```{r setup, include=FALSE, results = "asis"}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(pacman)
p_load(tidyverse, ipumsr, kableExtra, data.table)
```

## Loading data into environment
```{r loading data}
ddi <- read_ipums_ddi("usa_00004.xml")
data <- read_ipums_micro(ddi)
crosswalk_data <- read.csv("occ_crosswalk.csv")
```

## Cleaning data
```{r selecting variables}
# Selecting variables to keep 
data_clean <- data %>%
  select(YEAR, SAMPLE, SERIAL, PERNUM, PERWT, REGION,	METRO,	NCHILD,	NCHLT5,	SEX, AGE,	MARST, RACE, HISPAN, BPL, EDUC, EDUCD, LABFORCE,	CLASSWKR, CLASSWKRD, OCC1990,	WKSWORK1,	UHRSWORK, INCWAGE)
```

```{r remove percentiles}
# Removing the top (99%) and bottom (1%) income percentiles 
data_clean <- data_clean %>% group_by(YEAR) %>% filter(INCWAGE != 0) %>% filter(INCWAGE < quantile(data_clean$INCWAGE, 0.99) & INCWAGE > quantile(data_clean$INCWAGE, 0.01))
